            <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
            <p>
              Our brain is full of pathways between neurons. Based on our actions, or lack of actions, these pathways will become stronger or weaker. Neuroplasticity is the idea that by taking on new challenges we will form and strengthen these pathways, and we can essentially, rewire our brain.
            </p>
            <h3>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benfits people.</h3>
            <p>
              If we as humans are more aware to the fact that our brain can re-wire itself, and is not in a fixed unalterable state, then that will have a big effect on how we approach learning and teaching. It is also beneficial in medicine by helping people regain cognitive functions after suffering from strokes, and by helping re-wire people’s brains to cure depression and anxiety.
            </p>
            <h3>How might I engage with these principles for my own benfit.</h3>
            <p>
              By engaging in learning and challenging myself with activities, I can attempt to connect various problem-solving paths in my brain and strengthen them, by having these paths formed, it can change the default state of my brain when I approach learning. For example, I am a heavy procrastinator, that is my default brain state, in order to change this, I have focused more on manging my time, by setting goals to be completed and a small reward, like a coffee or a snack or half an hour of video games, based on the effort, I should start to see my default brain state take a new path away from procrastinating, and towards a more pragmatic approach.
            </p>
            <h3>Ways to increase neuroplasticity?</h3>
            <p>
              As briefly touched on in the above paragraph, a reward system based on the effort put in is a great motivator to increasing our neuroplasticity. In the tedtalk video below. Dr Kelly Lambert discusses the fact that doctors used to recommend knitting to women experiencing high levels of anxiety. Research done after the fact has shown that the challenge and effort needed to knit, or any skill for that matter, put increased serotonin and oxytocin in the brain, and lowered stress hormones.

            <h3>What is growth mindset? and what is its relevence?</h3>
            <p>
              The idea of growth mindset vs fixed mindset is, that with a growth mindset we believe that through effort it is possible to increase intelligence levels and enhance abilities, and that with a fixed mindset we believe that we don’t need to put in the effort because we are already set in our ways.
            </p> 
            <p>
              The importance and relevance of these ideas is that it can shape the way we approach learning and improving dramatically. If some one was to approach learning programming with a fixed mindset, once they got to a situation where they didn’t understand, or a problem they couldn’t solve, they would resign themselves to the fact that they’re ‘not good’ at this so they wouldn’t see the value in putting I the effort, believing that they’ll never understand. Whilst a fixed mindset would practice and put in the effort knowing that eventually they will get there and solve the problem, even if others are still learning faster, someone with a growth mindset will not let that put them off.
            </p>
            <h3>Surprises or changes I experienced whilset researching growth mindset</h3>
            <p>
              Whilst researching Growth mindset, I was surprised, and a little saddened at how damaging having a fixed mindset can be. Its certainly been an approach I’ve applied in situations.
            </p>
            <p>
              If this brief dive into growth mindset has changed anything for me, it would be this: Hope, there is hope for me personally to learn and develop, and there is also hope for everyone wanting to do the same thing, and that just by understanding the differences between growth and fixed mindset is the first, and most crucial, step to improvement.
            </p>
            <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into learning?></h3>
            <p>
              As I feel have already proved to myself so on this journey that I can learn new skills and ideas, I’m happy to take more actions to maintain this state. 
            </p>
            <p>
              More ways I could develop this mindset would into learning going forward are listed in this helpful article below. Ideas I will be trying to integrate as I progress are:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Replacing the word ‘failure’ with ‘learning’. </li>
                <li>Viewing challenges as opportunities.</li>
                <li>Celebrate growth with others, this will be great during bootcamp!</li>
                <li>Think more realistically about time and effort, ie. Don’t expect to learn everything quickly all the time, some things will require more effort that others.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
