          <h1>My identity, values and strengths</h1>
          <p>After an afternoon of hitting up folks who I’ve known for a while to give me a few short sentences about myself, it was a little surprising but also a relief to hear that most of what they said was in line with how I perceive myself. Before seeking other’s evaluations, I was wandering what certain people would say about me. I thought that different people would say different things and I wandered if that made me ‘fake’. I have also had multiple therapy sessions over the last couple of years, whilst the goal of these sessions was to cure my depression, self-discovery was inevitable.</p>
          <h3>Ethics</h3>
          <p>Having to make ethical decisions that have had consequences has been something I’ve successfully managed to avoid, a friend and former co-worker described me in a way that felt strange: He said “You’ve always been awesome to the people you love and polite to everyone else, but when you don’t like someone they just don’t exist to you.”</p>
          <p>This struck a chord with me because whilst I evaluated this to be true it made me wonder if I choose this attitude as a way to avoid conflict and therefore having to put my values and ethics to the test. It did remind me of when me and this particular friend were working together at a certain Wellington brewery, who used to make a controversially labelled product, eventually that product was pulled (it did take them a few years mind you), and then, before the dust had settled, they re-released this product under a new name and new marketing campaign, whilst giving the impression that they were the victims and that it had been hard for them, “we were so heartbroken…”, “what an emotional rollercoaster we’ve been on…” etc. etc. Now this rubbed me up the wrong way because I had to sell this hypocrisy to customers. And I was prepared to let my view on this be known, both to staff and customers, I think I felt I had to punish the company for this error of judgement that they seemed so unaware of. Anyway, I didn’t get any formal punishment and my view got validated by HR, I left the company on good terms a while after. Its strange to reflect on this because it still feels like such a non-issue. However It does lead me to the point that I strongly believe that there is not enough people being called out for their bullshit, just listen to the drivel that comes out of Mike Hosking’s mouth on a regular basis. </p>
          <h3>How my culture has shaped me</h3>
          <p>I think the general ‘kiwi culture’ has passed on to me the values of acceptance, fairness, and general curiosity. I grew up in Karori, in Wellington’s western suburbs, which has about as much culture as a mild butter-chicken curry. So naturally when I hit my twenties, like a lot of kiwis, I moved overseas in search of more personal identity and to see how the rest of the world lives. I spent most of my time in Melbourne but did a lot of traveling, usually to random countries I knew nothing about, just to fulfill my curiosity of discovering how the world works. Witnessing a lot of poverty and class bias as the result of political incompetence and corruption has intensified my view that everyone deserves a fair go in life. Although in contrast my extensive hospitality career has definitely made me super-jaded towards other humans at times.</p>
          <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
          <p>When it comes to my learning and career development,  my biggest limitation has been myself, and that voice inside my head, lots of time I’ve let obstacles stop me from progressing because I’m afraid of failure, Its comforting to know that this seems to be a normal human trait and that I’m not alone in battling inner-demons no matter how irrational they are.</p>
          <p>When it comes to strengths; I’m a fast learner, and once I get something, I get it. I’m good at processing situations logically most of the time, sometimes I overthink and over-process which leads to anxiety. I learn kinesthetically and visually so solving problems and YouTube videos are my preferred learning avenues.</p>
          <h3>How my strengths will help or hinder me on this journey</h3>
          <p>What will help me and probably hinder me the most on this learning journey is a curiosity to understand everything, already I’ve found myself going down rabbit holes just to get an understanding of how things worked, and then gotten stressed out when I don’t understand.</p> 
          <p>I see myself as a very malleable leaner, and I am always keen to try new approaches, methods, and skills. When it comes to teamwork I am a reluctant leader, I will lead if necessary, but I’m a much better ‘number two’ because I’m more than happy to follow direction and contribute my opinions and critiques as necessary and I don’t mind doing the grunt work. I feel this is a good balance, however it’s no the most pragmatic approach, because if everyone in a team situation shared this approach, you’d  just have folks sitting around going “who wants to lead?....”, “no, I insist….”, “I’d like to hear someone else’s opinion”…. And so on, then of course nothing would get done, this is where my malleability will come in handy.</p>
          <h3>Working productively with others</h3>
          <p>One of the most recent times I’ve experienced non-ego fueled group work, was about three years ago, when I studied and sat the cicerone exam (it’s like a sommelier for beer). It’s a very difficult exam and there is no study program, you just have to know the stuff. A colleague of mine set up a study group in where she would point us in the right direction and we would all contribute to the session. Moments of resistance or tension would come up when it came to organizing extra study times and keeping people in the loop, but in those scenarios we’d usually end up splitting the group in half or more and each half going off doing their own thing and then merging back together. The exam pass mark is 80% and only 50% of people pass it on the first go, our group broke that average, and I have no doubt it was because of the effort we put in together, and the way that every obstacle we hit as a group was dealt with in a mature and adult fashion. (I have to make a special mention to Reema, who set up and lead the group, and was amazing at holding everything together). I choose this example because it’s one of the only times in my professional/ educational life where I’ve been in a group situation with common goal that has actually worked for everyone without too much ego involved.</p>
