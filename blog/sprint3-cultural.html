            <h1>Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</h1>
            <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
            <p>Emotional intelligence, commonly refered to as EQ, is roughly defined as one’s ability to manage one’s emotions and the emotions of others. This includes: emotional awareness, which is one’s ability to be aware of their or others emotions and why they may be felling a certain way; The ability to harness emotions and apply them to situations and the ability to manage these emotions in a pragmatic way.</p>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is not something humans are born with, but it is something we develop. People with a high EG are more likely to: have a greater self-awareness; express and feel genuine empathy for others and process emotions allowing them to think before reacting. Whereas people with a lower EQ are more likely to: Justify negative emotions by blaming external factors; Show little or no empathy towards others and let their emotions push them to make irrational decisions.</p>
            <h3>How does EQ differ from IQ?</h3>
            <p>The difference between IQ and EQ is that of holistic thought vs analytic thought. IQ testing is used to measure abilities like: visual processing, knowledge of the world, fluid reasoning, quantitative reasoning and working memory. Whereas emotional intelligence is the use of abilities such as: identifying emotions, evaluating others’ emotions, controlling emotions, using/applying emotions and relating to others.</p>
            <p>The IQ is measures by standardized tests to produce a number that compares your intelligence with others. There are no such tests or methods for EQ because the ideas are a lot more abstract and there is no standardized number to reflect EQ.</p>
            <p>A person can learn and develop skills in emotional intelligence over time, whereas one’s IQ is believed generally set.</p>
            <h3>Why is EQ Important?</h3>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is important on a personal level, because being aware of your emotions, and being able to process them effectively can aid us on the path to happiness by helping us make better decisions. Studies have shown that people with higher emotional intelligence are more productive in, and outside the workplace. By being aware of your emotions you can gain a better understanding of who you are, and this can make you an effective role-model in society.</p>
            <p>In the social realm having a high EQ will allow you to form better relationships and help other people manage their emotions, thereby increasing their own EQ. Emotional Intelligence is widely considered to be an essential leadership quality, and leaders with a high EQ will lead much more productive and happier teams.</p>
