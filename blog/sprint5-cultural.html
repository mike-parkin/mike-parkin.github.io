           <h1>Reflecting on Core Learning</h1>
           <h3>What are three new things I’ve learned about myself and my ego from core learning?</h3>
           <p>
            Well egos are fragile, I knew that already, but I also learned that it is easier to pick up a broken ego than I initially thought. 
           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing I learned about myself is that I can subconsciously motivate myself, even if on the surface I have zero motivation. This week for example, I had a busy weekend of work and then an industry party, so on Monday and Tuesday I was feeling so tired and rundown. However, I was still sitting at the computer, ploughing through the JS, solving problems, even if my conscious mind and body would have rather stayed in bed and watched Netflix.
           </p>
           <p>
            The last, and maybe the most critical, thing I learned about myself was that I’m not to old to change habits, mindsets and values. Learning about EQ, Neuroplasticity and growth mindset was cool. I was feeling old at 32, now I’m feeling younger at 32.
           </p>
           <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
           <p>
            We can heavily impact our learning being aware of ourselves, our values and being able to exercise empathy. These skills will contribute to our overall emotional intelligence, and that will make us better listeners and better mentors which will help us become better learners and better programmers overall.  
           </p>
           <h3>What has surprised me the most about core learning?</h3>
           <p>
            With all these studies the positives of tings like EQ and growth mentality and the positive impact it can have on groups or individuals, I am surprised that these ideas have not been more widespread and implemented throughout society. 
           </p>
           <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
           <p>
            Having to write the blogs in a human readable way, when you have so many thoughts and information going around your head and you have to write it in a way that other people should be able to understand.
           </p>
           <h3>Why do you think a programming school spends so much time focused on core learning?</h3>
           <p>
            Because being able to code well doesn’t necessarily make you a good programmer, bring a good person is just as important. And its easier to get a job in tech if you’ve got good personal skills as opposed to being an arsehole. Obviously, that observation doesn’t apply to police and politicians.
           </p>
           <h3>Did the time spent studying core learning feel like a waste of time?</h3>
           <p>
            Hell no! The time spent doing the core was definitely not a waste of time.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Sprints 2 – 4 where the core work came before the tech, it was a great way to start the sprint. Learning new ways about how we as humans work, or how I personally react to things really helped set my brain up for the week ahead. 
           </p>
           <p>
            I think running through the core work was an excellent way to show us students that being a good programmer requires more skills than just knowing how to code. And by taking time to think about ourselves, what we’re good at and what we need to improve on will help enrich our learning , career and our personal lives.
           </p>
           <h1>BootCamp Prep</h1>
           <h3>What is my long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
           <p>
            My long term goal is to have a challenging job that keeps me engaged, whilst also working more sociable hours than I am currently. I haven’t quite mapped out a career pathway yet as I am still not 100% sure which area of tech I would like to end up in. but I’m hoping my time at the Dev Academy will help make that a bit more clear. 
           </p>
           <p>
            I would also like to pursue more education at the same time as building a career, even if it takes 6-7 years of part-time study, I would like to complete a bachelor of IT. 
           </p>
           <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in bootcamp?</h3>
           <p>
            Referring back to my learning plan blog from sprint-2, I think my biggest strength will be quick learning, but I will not be taking that for granted at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will be limited by my very short experience in all thing computers. Until June 2020 the most techy thing I’d ever done was to download and patch pirated games.
           </p>
           <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge will be in bootcamp?</h3>
           <p>
            My biggest non-tech challenge will be managing my time and not getting lost in a problem or challenge having to figure out every minute detail.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also battling through the days when my motivation takes a hit. And not letting that affect my work or that of my fellow students.
           </p>
           <h3>What non-technical skills – human skills – would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
           <p>
            I’m looking forward to developing the pair-programming skills, I think that will be awesome to take these skills out into the world, along with any teamwork skills and EQ skills.
           </p>
           <p>
            And of course my biggest challenge – time management. Whilst I have surprised myself throughout foundations. I don’t want that to be a fluke and would love to really nail down that skill.   
           </p>
           <h3>What are your expectations on yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
           <p>
            My commitment to myself for my time at bootcamp: I will always try to focus on tasks at hand, I will listen to all my fellow students, facilitators, and industry representatives. I gladly accept help from anyone who offers it, and will offer help to anyone who asks. I will do my best to make sure that me and my fellow students all get the best out of this bootcamp.
