           <h1>Reflecting on Core Learning</h1>
           <h3>What are three new things I’ve learned about myself and my ego from core learning?</h3>
           <p>
            Well egos are fragile, I knew that already, but I also learned that it is easier to pick up a broken ego than I initially thought. 
           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing I learned about myself is that I can subconsciously motivate myself, even if on the surface I have zero motivation. This week for example, I had a busy weekend of work and then an industry party, so on Monday and Tuesday I was feeling so tired and rundown. However, I was still sitting at the computer, ploughing through the JS, solving problems, even if my conscious mind and body would have rather stayed in bed and watched Netflix.
           </p>
           <p>
            The last, and maybe the most critical, thing I learned about myself was that I’m not to old to change habits, mindsets and values. Learning about EQ, Neuroplasticity and growth mindset was cool. I was feeling old at 32, now I’m feeling younger at 32.
           </p>
           <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
           <p>
            We can heavily impact our learning being aware of ourselves, our values and being able to exercise empathy. These skills will contribute to our overall emotional intelligence, and that will make us better listeners and better mentors which will help us become better learners and better programmers overall.  
           </p>
           <h3>What has surprised me the most about core learning?</h3>
           <p>
            With all these studies the positives of tings like EQ and growth mentality and the positive impact it can have on groups or individuals, I am surprised that these ideas have not been more widespread and implemented throughout society. 
           </p>
           <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
           <p>
            Having to write the blogs in a human readable way, when you have so many thoughts and information going around your head and you have to write it in a way that other people should be able to understand.
           </p>
           <h3>Why do you think a programming school spends so much time focused on core learning?</h3>
           <p>
            Because being able to code well doesn’t necessarily make you a good programmer, bring a good person is just as important. And its easier to get a job in tech if you’ve got good personal skills as opposed to being an arsehole. Obviously, that observation doesn’t apply to police and politicians.
           </p>
           <h3>Did the time spent studying core learning feel like a waste of time?</h3>
           <p>
            Hell no! The time spent doing the core was definitely not a waste of time.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Sprints 2 – 4 where the core work came before the tech, it was a great way to start the sprint. Learning new ways about how we as humans work, or how I personally react to things really helped set my brain up for the week ahead. 
           </p>
           <p>
            I think running through the core work was an excellent way to show us students that being a good programmer requires more skills than just knowing how to code. And by taking time to think about ourselves, what we’re good at and what we need to improve on will help enrich our learning , career and our personal lives.
