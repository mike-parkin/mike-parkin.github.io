          <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
          <h3>Long term goals and career pathway</h3>
          <p>My long term goals are quite broad, I would like to own my own town-house close to the city eventually, I am seeking a career change that will allow me more sociable hours to pursue my many other interests such as music, homebrewing, cooking and cheesemaking.</p>
          <p>As of writing this I have no clear career pathway, except a move away from what I am currently doing, I chose to pursue the tech industry because it is constantly evolving, which means there will always be new challenges. Where exactly I will fit within this behemoth is yet to be determined. </p>
          <h3>What human skills I would like to develop</h3>
          <p>developing a better self-awareness and self-evaluation skills to help me improve my employability is essential. I feel like I can be a bit rough round the edges, which is fine, but being able to refine my personality to suit, would be awesome.</p>
          <p>My team working ability is suitable, but I would love to develop this even more, because projects are always more fun when completed as a team working together. </p>
          <h3>My own strengths and limitations</h3>
          <p>My biggest strength is my fast-learning, once I grasp a concept or repeat an action one or two times, BAM! that’s it, I can move forward. That doesn’t mean I don’t struggle to understand things/concepts/formulas, sometimes it will take me a while to grasp particular ideas, but I try not to let this slow me down to much because I know I’ll get it eventually.</p>
          <p>My biggest limitation is time-management, though it is improving with age, I am still a master procrastinator. And tend to get distracted easily by random passing thoughts. I also have to refer back to the previous blog and give the voice in my head an honorable mention.</p>
          <h3>How I will manage my workload and other commitments</h3>
          <p>I’ve cut down my working hours in order to make sure I have enough time each week to complete the material and have a day of to do nothing at all! Yay Sunday, I am currently also working on a small programming paper for polytechnic, which requires about five hours a week, but I am just slotting that in wherever I can. </p>
          <h3>How I will seek help in a timely way and what I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p>So far I’ve managed to get to grips with the program, however I am not taking that for granted, so when I inevitably get stuck at some point my first port of call will be the foundations slack channel. The channel is active with a lot of knowledgeable people who seem more than happy to help. It is also great to have access to a facilitator, and I save any broader questions about the material, which do not require urgent attention, for the weekly meeting with John. I do not expect the facilitator to give me all the information I need, I believe they are there more as a guide to let me know I’m on the right track.</p>
