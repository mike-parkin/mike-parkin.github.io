            <h1>Problem Solving techniques</h1>
            <h3><em>For my non tech-savvy friends</em></h3>
            <h3>A simple problem tha got me stuck</h3>
            <p>
                I got stuck on a problem in a challenge called JS-Gradebook, this challenge was about taking names and grades and arranging them into a way that could contain both grades. The last challenge on this exercise was to write a piece of code that did all the work in one go, so you put the information into the code, and the code arranges it. Now I thought I had this one nailed, but errors were still being thrown, I was getting a little frustrated. I knew my logic was correct and that it was just a matter of me not using the correct syntax. Luckily I had my one on one with my facilitator at that time, so we got to look at it together and it turns out it was just a silly syntax error. What did I learn… that other people are helpful and syntax matters!
            </p>
            <h3>When I got all elegant solving a problem</h3>
            <p>
                My most elegant solving of a problem came in a challenge where we had to write code that would take a sentence and take the word buzz out of the sentence, this was the final of four challenges where we had to use similar methods to achieve similar results, so after being stuck on the last three challenges for ages. I think I’d finally got to grips with these new methods, I started by writing a small pseudo code then rolled writing the code with confidence, then Hey! It worked straight away! Except no…… It was only removing the word ‘buzz’ if it was lower case so ‘BuZZ’ & ‘buZz’ were still hanging around. I got talking to my little duck and figured out that I can convert all the letters to the same case and remove them that way.
            </p>
            <h3>How do I feel using various problem solving techniques?</h3>
            <h3><em>Pseudocode</em></h3>
            <p>
                I feel good using pseudocode when beginning a new problem, however once I was deep into a problem then all pseudocode went out the window.
            </p>
            <h3><em>Trying Something</em></h3>
            <p>
                Not my favourite method, I would only try something as a last resort, so if I'm in that postion my confidence will have taken a hit or two.
            </p>
            <h3><em>Rubber Ducky Method</em></h3>
            <p>
                Love it, its funny and it makes your brain change tack. It gets you to think of the problem in a way you might never have used if you were just going over the problem in your head.
            </p>
            <h3><em>Reading the Error Messages</em></h3>
            <p>
                I don’t look at error messages as a big scary thing anymore, usually they can point you to the line and location of what’s throwing the error, so I definitely view them as more help than hindrance.
            </p>
            <h3><em>console.log()-ing</em></h3>
            <p>
                I got used to using this to check my variables were at their expected values at certain points in the code. I don’t think I could solve a problem with it but it helps me narrow down where the issue might be.
            </p>
            <h3><em>Googling</em></h3>
            <p>
                I found google extremely useful for finding out how the code methods and syntax work, but when using google to solve specific problems, well that came down to luck.
            </p>
            <h3><em>Asking Peers for Help</em></h3>
            <p>
                I haven’t reached out to my peers for help yet, but I’m confident that it’ll be the best method to use in the future
            </p>
            <h3><em>Asking Coaches for Help</em></h3>
            <p>
                My facilitator, John, was great helping me solve an issue (mentioned above). Definitely a great avenue to turn to for fixing issues
            </p>
            <h3><em>Reflection</em></h3>
            <p>
                This has been great to reassess my problem-solving skills outside the problem-solving environment. Using reflection, I’ve been able to get a better understanding of why my solutions have worked (especially if the answer came of the back of a google search).
